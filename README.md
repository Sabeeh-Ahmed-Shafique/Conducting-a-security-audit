##Risk Assessment Summary

Scope & Goals
The audit covers Botium Toys’ entire security program, including IT assets, internal networks, employee devices, systems, and compliance practices. The main goal is to evaluate existing assets, controls, and compliance to identify gaps and recommend improvements to strengthen the company’s security posture.

##Current Assets

On-premises equipment and employee devices (desktops, laptops, smartphones, peripherals, surveillance cameras, etc.)

Retail storefront products and adjoining warehouse inventory

Management of critical systems (accounting, telecom, ecommerce, inventory, databases, security tools)

Internet access and internal network infrastructure

Data retention/storage systems and legacy systems requiring manual oversight

##Risk Assessment

Key Risks:

Inadequate asset management and classification

Lack of encryption for sensitive customer/credit card data

Overly broad employee access to customer PII/SPII and cardholder data

Weak password policies and no centralized password management

Absence of intrusion detection systems (IDS)

No disaster recovery or backup plans

Unclear maintenance schedule for legacy systems

Existing Controls:

Firewalls with security rules

Antivirus protection monitored by IT

Availability and integrity safeguards

EU customer breach notification plan

Documented privacy policies and procedures

Physical security measures (locks, CCTV, fire detection/prevention)

##Risk Score: 8/10 (High)
The organization faces significant risks due to weak access controls, lack of encryption, missing recovery plans, and non-compliance with regulatory standards.

##Impact

Medium impact on operations (due to uncertainty around asset value/risk)

High regulatory and compliance impact (potential fines, data breaches, and customer trust loss)
